- 👋 Hi, I’m @NettyBee (Lynette)  
I am in the process of avidly learning computer science and programming. I am a complete beginner however, so I'm also getting the hang of GitHub as well :)

- 👀 I'm still exploring my interests in CompSci & I have a *long* way to go!  
      Currently I’m interested in creative and interactive applications such as animation, interactive fiction. Something that has grabbed my attention lately is the combination of Stop-motion animation with Virtual Reality. I also enjoy reading about AI/machine learning.  
      Otherwise I quite enjoy running, cycling, and scaring myself silly with various horror media.
- 🌱 I’m trying to learn as much as possible. The last course I did was the online CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course (loved it!). Languages I've learnt from the course include C, Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and frameworks include Flask/AJAX. 
      For the final project of the course I made an Interactive Fiction game - for this I learnt & used the Interactive Fiction scripting language, Ink.  
      I'm now in the midst of applying for a place on various Computer Science Masters conversion courses.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any creative or interactive media project - although of course bear in mind that I am a beginner!
